# Human Entrance Counter with PeekingDuck
Human Entrance Counter is a jointly-collaborated project between [SPAI](https://www.instagram.com/spai.sp/) and [SP-RITE](https://www.instagram.com/sp.riteclub/) and its aim is to detect the amount of human traffic moving in and out of a bounded region at any given time.

## Project Overview

The project utilizes [PeekingDuck](https://github.com/aimakerspace/PeekingDuck) with custom nodes for human detection and tracking along with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) as backend controller.

### Get Footfall History of a Location

GET `/history/:location/:startTime/:endTime`
- Inputs: 
    - locationname(`string`)
    - startTime(`string in YYYYMMDDhhmmss`)
    - endTime(`string in YYYYMMDDhhmmss`)
- Outputs: 
    - json array of records with each records having:
        - footfallid (`int`)
        - time (`string in YYYYMMDDhhmmss`)
        - curentfootfall (`int`)
        - location (`string`)
        - netfootfall (`int`)
- Example:
    ```get /history/fc1/20211111024000/20211114130000```

    output:
    ```
    [
        {
            "footfallid": 34,
            "time": "20211114101000",
            "currentfootfall": 20,
            "location": "fc1",
            "netfootfall": 20
        },
        {
            "footfallid": 35,
            "time": "20211114111000",
            "currentfootfall": 40,
            "location": "fc1",
            "netfootfall": 20
        }
    ]
    ```
    > currentfootfall = total footfall(all added together), netfootfall = footfall recorded at time of record

### Get Latest Footfall of a Location
GET `/latest/:location`
- Inputs: 
    - locationname (`string`)
- Output: 
    - json object with 1 record
        - footfallid (`int`)
        - time (`string in YYYYMMDDhhmmss`)
        - curentfootfall (`int`)
        - location (`string`)
- Example:
    ```get /latest/fc6```

    output:
    ```
    {
        "footfallid": 33,
        "time": "20211111024500",
        "currentfootfall": 0,
        "location": "fc6"
    }
    ```

### Record Footfall History
POST `/history`
- Inputs: 
    - locationname(string)
    - startTime(string in YYYYMMDDhhmmss)
    - netfootfall (int)
- Output: 
    - empty array, []
- Example:
    ```post /history```

    _body_:
    ```
    time:20211114121500
    netfootfall:30
    location:fc1
    ```
    output: []
