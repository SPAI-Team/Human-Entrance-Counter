    The draw legend node dynamically pulls the output results of previous nodes

    object counts and object count in zones.

    all_legend_item: config is all possible items that can be drawn in legend box
    include: is used to select which information would be drawn
    This is so we can have the outputs but choose not to drawn on screen

    Inputs:

        all (:obj:`Any`): Receives inputs from all preceding outputs to use
        ass dynamic input for legend creation.

    Outputs:
        |none|

    Configs:
        position (:obj:`str`): **default = "bottom"**
            Position to draw legend box. "top" draws it at the top-left position
            while "bottom" draws it at bottom-left.

        include (:obj:`list`): **default = ["all_legend_items"]**
            List of information to draw. Current can draw "fps", "count" and/or
            "zone_count". The default value "all_legend_items" draws everything
